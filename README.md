# Fruit-Classification

To be able to use this repo, you will need to download the dataset from here -> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karimabdulnabi/fruit-classification10-class

- Once do you have the data set, will be needed to run the pre-process file to generate a clean folder with all the valid images
- Then u are ready to run the hyperams searchs or the models files


And that's all for now, I'll create a more specified readme with the results on my freetime
I hope this help you to deal with some similar task
